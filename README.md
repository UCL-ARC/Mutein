# Mutein
#### Overview
This is a research project to reanalyse multiple existing datasets from publications, aiming to understand the effects of mutations on protein structure, and through that to ultimately understand the proteins' functions and interactions. The datasets are DNA sequence data, including target capture of specific gene sets, whole exome capture and whole genome capture, from studies looking at diseased and normal tissue from various tissue types.
