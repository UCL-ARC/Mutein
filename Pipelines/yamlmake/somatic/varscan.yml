    # Varscan requires [m]pileup format as input.
    # We could have instead generated a pileup file from each _bqsr.bam file, and then passed these pairwise to varscan,
    # but the pileup files are very large and would have to persist until all varscan jobs are finished.
    # Better to use extra CPU generating a single pileup for each pair of bams we want to analyse,
    # piped directly into varscan so no intermediate disk space is needed.
    # Incidentally, if you pass two files into varscan somatic like so, you get this message:
    # $ varscan somatic file1.mpileup file2.mpileup outfiletemplate
    # ...
    # NOTICE: While dual input files are still supported, using a single mpileup file (normal-tumor) with the --mpileup 1 setting is strongly recommended.
    # This is where the option --mpileup 1 comes from, which doesn't seem to be documented in the help text.
