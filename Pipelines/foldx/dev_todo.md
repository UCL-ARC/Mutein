#### dev to do list
- Add a param for the user's home directory in the main bash scripts
- Make the number of repairs confugurable and use the repaired file with the specified number from thruputs
- Change the files so there is only 1 python file per bash script (__main__)
- Get python actions for continuous integration working
- Implement a full dummy test data set to mimic an HPC batch
- Get a so called "empty" run that can work in CI (foldx won't work)
- Make the code and comments and variables up to rsdg standard
- Make a fully demonstrable show of the orders-of-mutations problem in its own test file
- Anaytics - establish agreement or what the future action is on the number differences as per above
- Make the batch dependency, script names and times (everything for qsub) configurable from file not hard coded
- make the test set 1tst for potential multiple ones

### done
