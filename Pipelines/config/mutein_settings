## the user should copy this script into a subfolder of their
## main data folder called config and then source it to
## set up their working environment:
##
##   source ./config/mutein_settings
##
## conda must already be installed manually
## this script will set up the mutein_main conda environment
## if not already created, and will *keep it active* after it exits
## so the user can start using mutein

## ============ ONLY EDIT THIS SECTION ============

#set this to the location you put the Mutein repository folder
export MUT_DIR=~/repos/Mutein

#set this to the location of your Mutein data folder
export MUT_DATA=~/549_mutein
